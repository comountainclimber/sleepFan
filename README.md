an iOS app powered by react-native

still very much a work in progress BUT

To run the prototype app (will only work if you have xcode installed): 

1.) clone this repository

2.) `npm install`

3.) `react-native run-ios`

** You can debug and inspect in chrome developer tools (which is amazing) by pressing command+control+z and then selecting enable Chrome debbugging
